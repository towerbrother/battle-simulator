## React-Weather-App

A battle simulator App build with React Javascript library.

## Motivation

The App has been build as learning opportunity during my path to become a Software Engineer (self-taught). It is the second App I built as part of the journey.

## Tech/framework used

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and built using the following technologies:

- React
- Javascript
- CSS

## Features

The App interface is a single button that simulates dice rolling for both player and monster.

The "hit" is calculated as the difference of the sum of the two dice for player and monster. A message shows at every step whether it was a draw or one of the two contenstants won the round.

Each contestant starts with 100 health points. The game finishes when one of the two reaches 0 health points.

## Credits

I have been receiving a lot of support and motivation from the Codecademy London (UK) Meetup group, in particular from [Giacomo Sorbi](https://github.com/GiacomoSorbi) to whom I am particularly thankful. Grazie! :grinning:
